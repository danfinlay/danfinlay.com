##Version 3 or so...

I've taken a few passes at this page so far, and here's the vision of the current one:

*Backed by Node.js
It's my back-end platform of choice, and it's wicked fast.
*Responsive Interface using Bootstrap
Most connections these days are from a phone, so a modern web site should tailor to one.
*Entirely streaming interface
You probably won't notice on my site, since it's a low-traffic example, but the server never waits for a file to load to start delivering it.  That means when viewing one of my many list-style pages, it is sending each entry off to the client as it's loaded, keeping the server using little memory, able to handle many connections, and more responsive for the user.

###Organization
Excuse me while I keep myself organized.  I have a pretty multi-faceted life, and I don't know what the average visitor of my site is looking for, so I've opted for an almost operating-system-like interface, providing a collapsing menu system for users to find the aspects of me that interests them.
