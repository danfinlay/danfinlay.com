<strong><h3>Bloccoli</h3></strong>
My time teaching using <a href="http://mit.scratch.edu">MIT's Scratch</a> imbued me with a deep respect for the power of visual blocks to empower young children to program their own games and animations.<br>

When Google released Blockly, they made it possible for anyone to build their own block-based programming environment, and my own contribution to this vision was to allow for modular adding of new blocks by anyone.<br>

Still a work in progress, <a href="http://bloccoli.herokuapp.com">Bloccoli</a> allows any Blockly-compatible blocks to easily be imported into the same environment, which then renders the code into a real web page, run right in a browser iFrame.<br>
