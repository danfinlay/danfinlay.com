<strong><h3>Hopswap</h3></strong>
My first Web 2.0 site was designed to allow people to trade home-brewed beer on the internet.  It was built entirely in client-side Javascript using the <a href="https://parse.com/">Parse</a> framework.<br>

Ultimately I became aware of <a href="http://brewshuffle.com/">a competitor</a> that had been around for years, had partnerships, and still hadn't gained a strong following, making me think the audience wasn't big enough to fight for.<br><br>
I have however re-used pieces of this code-base for projects such as <a href="http://strideprogram.org/oprcrimes/">OPR Crime Map</a>.
