<h3>Resistance Probability Estimator</h3>
I made <a href="http://www.danfinlay.com/projects/resistance/probability/">a web app</a> for calculating probabilities in the board game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Resistance_(game)">The Resistance</a>.<br><br>
It's a very intense game where a couple people in the group are secretly chosen as spies, and the group has to select teams to go on missions, but the spies have the ability to secretly sabotage missions they are on.<br><br>
I took the opportunity to apply some of the Bayesian statistics I'd been learning over at Udacity's Statistics 101 course, and the result is a very precise, systematic approach to the logical side of this very bluff-heavy game.
