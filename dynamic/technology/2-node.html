My latest programming fix has been Node.js, and the notion that you can use Javascript anywhere, from web sites, to servers, to video games.<br><br>
I've published <a href="https://npmjs.org/~danfinlay">a few modules</a> on the npm package repository, attended NodeConf 2013, and have generally grown to really cherish the Node.js community for its diversity, creativity, and friendliness.<br><br>
In fact, this site is served with Node, using domains for error handling and streams for delivering all of the content.  That means you start loading the web page before the server has even read the whole first file involved.<br><br>
The source code is on github <a href="github.com/flyswatter/danfinlay.com">here</a>.
