During that time, I performed in over a thousand shows for audiences ranging from weekend performances downtown, to weddings, bar mitzvahs, festivals, and corporate teambuilding workshops for companies including Google, Intel, and eBay.<br><br>

<h3>Fartomin</h3>
Sure, it was my first attempt at an app.  But when someone asks about it, I don't show them the app. I show them this promo video.  It's one of my finer digital comedies.<br>

<h3>Screenwriting</h3>
I've written around seven sitcom spec scripts.<br><br>
My corpus includes scripts for Community, Bob's Burgers, American Dad, and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.<br><br>
I haven't gotten them properly copyrighted, so if you'd like to take a read, drop me a line, I'm sure I'd be happy to share.

<h3>Time Travel Bill</h3>
This is a 2-minute sitcom pilot that I made in college.  It's about a kid with a time hat, and how he uses it to solve every day problems.  Warning: Explicit language.<br>
