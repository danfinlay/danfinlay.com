I spent seven years performing improv comedy with <a href="http://www.comedysportzsanjose.com">ComedySportz San Jose</a>, the Bay Area's longest running show.<br><br>

During that time, I performed in over a thousand shows for audiences ranging from weekend performances downtown, to weddings, bar mitzvahs, festivals, and corporate teambuilding workshops for companies including Google, Intel, and eBay.<br><br>
