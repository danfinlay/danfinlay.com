<h3>Screenwriting</h3>
I never pursued it seriously, but I did write around seven sitcom spec scripts in my time.<br><br>
My corpus includes scripts for Community, Bob's Burgers, American Dad, and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.<br><br>
I've never bothered to get them properly copyrighted, so if you'd like to take a read, drop me a line, I'm sure I'd be happy to share.
