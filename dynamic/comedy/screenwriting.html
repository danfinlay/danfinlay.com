<h3>Screenwriting</h3>
I've written around seven sitcom spec scripts.<br><br>
My corpus includes scripts for Community, Bob's Burgers, American Dad, and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.<br><br>
I haven't gotten them properly copyrighted, so if you'd like to take a read, drop me a line, I'm sure I'd be happy to share.
