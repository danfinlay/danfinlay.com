	<h3>Quaternions Explained</h3>
	If you ever want to rotate an object in 3D space, you'll need to touch the mathematics of Quaternions.  I worked hard for my understanding of them, and felt there wasn't an approachable enough introduction to the subject, so I made this video.  To date, it's the top result for a YouTube search of "Quaternions"<br>
